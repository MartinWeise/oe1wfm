## Yaesu FT-891

I picked up the hobby of amateur radio in late 2021 and was thrilled from the start. My first attempts with a Hytera
PD-785g analogue and digital mode on 70cm was not very satisfying in the long run, so I invested into a new Yaesu FT-891
and mobile setup (shown below).

With the purchase of a brand new Yaesu FT-891 and a dipole antenna from GB, my hobby got a new rush. The setup is fully
mobile and runs on a 6Ah LiFePO4 battery. You see below that I use it in every condition, especially winter at around
0°C (32°F), the battery lasts around 3h on SSB ~20W and around 5h on QRP modes.

### Antenna

I live in the heart of Vienna in the 3<sup>rd</sup> district very close to the city center in a flat that surrounded by
concrete. Therefore, and because I like to spend my free days outside I decided to buy a SOTA antenna with beam.
After some research, I discovered the excellent UK-based shop of SOTA Beams and decided to order
the [Tactical 7000hds](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/tactical-7000hds-compact-heavy-duty-7-m-23-ft-mast/) fiberglass
beam with the [Band Hopper III](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/band-hopper-iii-three-band-linked-dipole/), a portable
dipole antenna system (40/30/20m) with wire winders and a balun without the need for a tuner.

Unfortunately I did not order the [Multi Function Guying Kit](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/multi-function-guying-kit/),
but only the guying rings for 35mm and 22mm, so I had to come up with my own guying kit. The first attempt (above) shows
the thick ropes (about 7mm) I had at home with zipties. It somehow worked, but the ropes are too elastic for properly
holding the mast in place when operating in windy situations. I therefore replaced the whole system with 3mm paracord
and tent hooks which worked very fine. Note that the cord is fixed on each end with simple electrical crimps.

The makeshift mast guying kit above, made from cardboard worked for some time but proved to be too small. I therefore
looked up the winder from the Multi Function Guying Kit and found the manufacturer. It turned out to be produced for
sport-kites, I could order them (without the strings) for around 6€ each. I can absolutely recommend those!

### Power Supply

Since the Yaesu FT-891 does not come with a ready to use power plug, I decided to use EC-5 connectors because of
their availability and high current rate (up to 90A) on the connectors and the pre-shipped 10 gauge wires that withstand
up to 20-30A. With a maximum power output of 100W from the Yaesu FT-891, I want them to not be a bottleneck after all.

However, due to my limited skills in soldering the wires and the general popularity of Anderson Power Pole connectors,
I decided against them within months. The Power Pole system is way easier to install for people like me and with 10
gauge cables at my disposal laying around anyways, I finally moved towards them.

To facilitate this in a all-in way, I had to get rid of the default power plug on the Yaesu FT-891 and replacing it with
a custom casing for the power pole system. Fortunately, the prototyping community is very open and provides
a [model for this exact modification](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5443777) by DG7PX that can facilitate this.
Using a Prusa MK3 from an organization I'm affiliated with and the help of a colleague, I was able to print the three
parts in about 2 hours. The result is very stable, especially the integrated pole for keeping the power pole connector
in place.

For the paracord grounding I am using regular camping tent pegs.

### Equipment

Unfortunately the knobs of the Yaesu FT-891 are sticking out from the main body to a degree where many portable HAMs
want to protect them from material stress and damage. I found this
excellent [model of protection rails](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4757295) from IU1OPK to ease also my concerns.

I was able to print them using standard black PLA filament and 20% infill and automatic support structures. I can't
remember the nozzle. This took about 20 hours to complete in four pieces, two need to be glued together. The result is
very stable and lightweight.
