### Antenna

I live in the heart of Vienna in the 3<sup>rd</sup> district very close to the city center in a flat that surrounded by
concrete. Therefore, and because I like to spend my free days outside I decided to buy a SOTA antenna with beam.
After some research, I discovered the excellent UK-based shop of SOTA Beams and decided to order
the [Tactical 7000hds](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/tactical-7000hds-compact-heavy-duty-7-m-23-ft-mast/) fiberglass
beam with the [Band Hopper III](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/band-hopper-iii-three-band-linked-dipole/), a portable
dipole antenna system (40/30/20m) with wire winders and a balun without the need for a tuner.

Unfortunately I did not order the [Multi Function Guying Kit](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/multi-function-guying-kit/),
but only the guying rings for 35mm and 22mm, so I had to come up with my own guying kit. The first attempt (above) shows
the thick ropes (about 7mm) I had at home with zipties. It somehow worked, but the ropes are too elastic for properly
holding the mast in place when operating in windy situations. I therefore replaced the whole system with 3mm paracord
and tent hooks which worked very fine. Note that the cord is fixed on each end with simple electrical crimps.

### Power Supply

Since the Yaesu FT-891 does not come with a ready to use power plug, I decided to use EC-5 connectors because of
their availability and high current rate (up to 90A) on the connectors and the pre-shipped 10 gauge wires that withstand
up to 20-30A. With a maximum power output of 100W from the Yaesu FT-891, I want them to not be a bottleneck after all.

However, due to my limited skills in soldering the wires and the general popularity of Anderson Power Pole connectors,
I decided against them within months. The Power Pole system is way easier to install for people like me and with 10
gauge cables at my disposal laying around anyways, I finally moved towards them.

To facilitate this in a all-in way, I had to get rid of the default power plug on the Yaesu FT-891 and replacing it with
a custom casing for the power pole system. Fortunately, the prototyping community is very open and provides
a [model for this exact modification](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5443777) by DG7PX that can facilitate this.
Using a Prusa MK3 from an organization I'm affiliated with and the help of a colleague, I was able to print the three
parts in about 2 hours. The result is very stable, especially the integrated pole for keeping the power pole connector
in place.

For the paracord grounding I am using regular camping tent pegs.

### Equipment

Unfortunately the knobs of the Yaesu FT-891 are sticking out from the main body to a degree where many portable HAMs
want to protect them from material stress and damage. I found this
excellent [model of protection rails](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4757295) from IU1OPK to ease also my concerns.

I was able to print them using standard black PLA filament and 20% infill and automatic support structures. I can't
remember the nozzle. This took about 20 hours to complete in four pieces, two need to be glued together. The result is
very stable and lightweight.

I use a custom WSJT-X wire and an external soundcard for FT8. More will come soon.

### Operation

I am currently in the process of migrating to a better backpack, stay tuned.
