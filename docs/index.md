Martin is a licensed CEPT amateur radio operator based in Vienna, Austria. This website is a personal
(re-)collection of my activities in the park, summit and on the island. If you had a QSO with me, please send me your
QSL via [QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/oe1wfm), e-mail or regular mail.

The purpose of this website is a personal recollection of activations & giving new amateur radio enthusiasts a quick
overview of the hobby as well as giving recommendations to help in building your own portable station.

## Station Overview

He is operating a fully mobile manpack with a new Yaesu FT-891 on 40/30/20m bands and a used Hytera PD-785g DMR on 70cm. 
Please spot me on [POTA](https://pota.app/#/profile/OE1WFM), [SOTA](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/) or IOTA if you heard me! I very much appreciate it!

If you had a QSO with me, chances are 99% they come from my home 
QTH [JN88ee](https://www.levinecentral.com/ham/grid_square.php?Grid=JN88ee) as I like to be outdoors and have 
less-frequented park nearby where I can set-up my three-band 7 meter dipole/inverted vee antenna.
