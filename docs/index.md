Martin is a licensed CEPT amateur radio operator based in Vienna, Austria. This website is a personal
(re-)collection of my activities on 70cm both analogue and digital modes.

## Hardware Overview

My station consists of a used, commercial Hytera PD-785g device (DMR) with 70cm band capabilities.

## Software Overview

I use the standard Hytera CPS and a custom code plug for programming the Hytera PD-785g, see my short intro and download
the code plug for firmware version A9.00.04.805.iM in the [Software](/software) section.

## Operation

I mostly listen analogue to conversations
at [OE1XUU](https://www.repeaterbook.com/row_repeaters/details.php?state_id=AT&ID=356) on 70cm analogue as it was the
first station I successfully programmed into my station that did not require any callsign for SWL. I listed to the
famous [Kahlenbergrunde](http://oe1iah.at/Betrieb/KBDaily.shtml) for many years while learning for the HAM radio exam or
walking around while we had COVID-19 lockdown. I also listen
to [OE1XDT](https://www.repeaterbook.com/row_repeaters/details.php?state_id=AT&ID=8454) (DMR) to TG232 and TG2321.
