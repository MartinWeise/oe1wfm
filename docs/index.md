Martin is a licensed CEPT amateur radio operator based in Vienna, Austria. This website is a personal
(re-)collection of my activities in the park, summit and on the island. If you had a QSO with me, please send me your
QSL via [QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/db/oe1wfm), e-mail or regular mail.

Please spot me on POTA, SOTA or IOTA if you heard me! I very much appreciate it!
