# OE1WFM

## Hardware Overview

My station consists of a used, commercial Hytera PD-875g device (DMR) with 2m/70cm band capabilities.

## Software Overview

I use the Hytera CPS and a modified code plug I found on the Internet (years ago) for programming the Hytera PD-875g.

## Operation

I mostly listen analogue to conversations at [OE1XUU](https://www.hamqth.com/OE1XUU) on 70cm analogue as it was the
firststation I successfully programmed into my station that did not require any callsign for SWL. I listed to the
famous [Kahlenbergrunde](http://oe1iah.at/Betrieb/KBDaily.shtml) for many years while learning for the HAM radio exam or
walking around while we had COVID-19 lockdown.
