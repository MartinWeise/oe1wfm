## Hotspot

I am currently experimenting with Pi-Star. More to follow.

## Station

My station is a used Hytera PD-785g with a custom code plug. I downloaded the Hytera CPS programming software
from [hamdigitaal.nl](https://www.hamdigitaal.nl/hytera-software-1/). You can download a code plug for OE1 (Vienna) in
the [Software](/software/#code-plug) section.
