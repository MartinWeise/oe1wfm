## Hytera PD-785g

My station is a used Hytera PD-785g with a custom code plug. I downloaded the Hytera CPS programming software
from [hamdigitaal.nl](https://www.hamdigitaal.nl/hytera-software-1/). The radio operates in the 70cm band.

### Equipment

During the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria starting from February, I bought a audio cable extension to covertly listening
to the famous Kahlenbergrunde at OE1XUU and walking outside in the park. It gave me a good reason to leave my apartment
and have some company.

### Operation

The [DMR Cheat Sheet](https://pool.dl5rfk.org/DMR-Cheatsheet.pdf)<sup>(DE)</sup> [^1] was really helpful to get a grasp
on DMR,
Talk Groups, Time Slots, etc.
